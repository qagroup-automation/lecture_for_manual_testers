Download a web driver and place it somewhere on you local machine or within this project. Im my case, for chromedriver.exe on Windows, the location is './selenium_standalone_binaries/windows/googlechrome/64bit/chromedriver.exe'

The test class is `LocalHtmlFileInBrowserTest` and placed in `/src/test/java/com/qagroup/start` folder.

One should edit the test class a little bit to provide correct paths to both webdriver and `example.html` files.

Have a fun learning!
